# Denford PCB Engraver Tutorial

This tutorial will lead you through using the [Denford PCB Engraver](https://denford.co.uk/products/pcb-engraver/) to mill a small breakout board for a surface mount ATtiny85. The tutorial was written specifically for the FabLab at the University of Strathclyde, but should be applicable to anyone with a Denford PCB Engraver.

The best way to use the tutorial is in the browser. You can start at the beginning my going to the [Introduction](doc/introduction.md) or use the [Index](doc/index.md) to jump straight to a specific section.

The [latest release](https://github.com/icchalmers/Denford-PCB-Engraver-Tutorial/releases) of the tutorial includes all of the example files and also has a PDF version that is easier for printing.
