# Denford PCB Engraver

## Overview

You can find the full specification for the engraver on the [Denford website](https://denford.co.uk/products/pcb-engraver/). For our purposes, only two of the features are worth discussing:

- The maximum board size is 360 mm x 210 mm.
- The Z axis (that is, the bit that goes up and down) "floats" on top of the workpiece. The big advantage this brings over a traditional CNC is that the depth of cut into the copper (which is only 0.035 mm think) doesn't rely so heavily on the workpiece being completely flat with respect to the machine. That means it's easier to setup and using V-shaped cutting bits give more consistent cut widths.
