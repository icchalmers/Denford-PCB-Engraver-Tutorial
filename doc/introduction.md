# Introduction

This tutorial will lead you through using the [Denford PCB Engraver](https://denford.co.uk/products/pcb-engraver/) to mill a small breakout board for a surface mount ATtiny85. The tutorial was written specifically for the FabLab at the University of Strathclyde, but should be applicable to anyone with a Denford PCB Engraver.

All the files for this tutorial can be found on my github: <https://github.com/icchalmers/Denford-PCB-Engraver-Tutorial>

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you already know how to design a PCB in your CAD software of choice and generate gerber files for fabrication. The tutorial does cover how to generate gerbers suitable for the engraver using KiCAD, but the general settings should be easy enough to translate to other software (Eagle, Altium etc).

If you don't know how to design a PCB yet, I would recommend looking at [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/). Here are a few recommended resources to get your started:

- The KiCAD website has a (small) list of [recommended resources](https://www.kicad.org/help/learning-resources/).
- Chris Gammel of [Contextual Elextronics](https://contextualelectronics.com/) has two excellent free course that teach you how to design a simple PCB:
  - [Shine On You Crazy KiCAD](https://contextualelectronics.com/courses/shine-on-you-crazy-kicad/)
  - [Getting to Blinky 5.0](https://contextualelectronics.com/courses/getting-to-blinky-5-0/)
